<p>Here are 5 steps of encouragement.</p>

<ol>
<li>Reflect on the root of the conflict,how has words,traumas,and preconcieved notions effected your quality of being?</li>

<li>Use lets talk lets listen with an open mind and receptive heart.
I challenge users to go beyond emotional confort. 
caution! try to avoid approaching this website as a social media,
we're here to heal and grow not uproot or destroy</li>

<li>Know that you're not looking to be validated; more so,the fact you're contributing to resolution is greatly benefitcial and productive. you cant put a price tag on healing</li>

<li>Spread the energy:love, compassion and forgiveness is not something we are born with; however,it can spread and become contagious,B,T.W. this is a cancer we want 2 spread</li>

<li>Prepare yourself to come out of your comfort zone, be Courageous!! Having Courage is being able to look your giants in the face.
It wont be easy, anything worth slaying or overcoming is never easy; however, it is life changing and fullfilling</li>
